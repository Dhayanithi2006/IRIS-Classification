IRIS-CLASSIFICATION
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.
Using the classic Iris dataset, two models were trained and evaluated:

    Decision Tree Classifier
    Logistic Regression

The best-performing model is automatically selected.
